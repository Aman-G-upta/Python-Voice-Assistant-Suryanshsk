## DEBATE BUDDY
# Goal ðŸŽ¯
The goal of this project is to create an interactive Virtual Debate Partner, Debate Buddy, that helps users improve their debating skills by providing arguments, counterarguments, and constructive feedback on various topics.

# Description ðŸ§¾
Debate Buddy is a voice-activated application that allows users to engage in debates on a wide range of topics. Users can select a topic from a list and initiate a debate, receiving prompts and arguments from the assistant. The Debate Buddy provides immediate feedback on the userâ€™s responses, encourages critical thinking, and suggests areas for improvement. By implementing fundamental programming concepts in Python, this project offers an engaging and supportive way for users to refine their debate skills and enhance their confidence in public speaking.

# What I Have Done ðŸ§®

Developed a voice-controlled interface that allows users to choose topics and engage in debates using spoken commands.
Integrated a dynamic fetching system to obtain a variety of debate topics and their corresponding arguments from an online source.
Implemented real-time feedback mechanisms that guide users on their debating style and offer suggestions for improvement.
# Libraries Needed

speech_recognition - To capture and recognize user voice input.
pyttsx3 - For text-to-speech functionality, providing an auditory experience for users.
requests - To fetch debate topics and arguments from an online API.
# Technologies used
